[What do we Mean by an Argument?](http://writingcenter.unc.edu/handouts/argument/) – An excellent discussion of what we mean by terms such as argument, claim, evidence, and counterargument in essays such as our Essay 2 and 3—and most essays you will write in college. It is from the Writing Center at UNC-Chapel Hill.

[Thesis](http://writingcenter.unc.edu/handouts/thesis-statements/) – A good explanation of what a thesis is and how it works in an essay. This site also contains links to additional sites on "thesis".

[Taylor Mali on speaking with conviction](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OEBZkWkkdZA) – Youtube clip

These two pieces about punctuation are especially useful because they're from the point of view of writers (not teachers or grammarians):
